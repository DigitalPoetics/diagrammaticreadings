		<blockquote  class="paragraph"><q>The ideal for a book would be to lay everything out on a plane of exteriority of this kind, on a single page, the same sheet: lived events, historical determinations, concepts, individuals, groups, social formations.</q></blockquote>

		<p class="paragraph">Welcome to Diagrammatic Readings!</p>	

		<p class="paragraph">Here, you'll find the figures I made while performing research on the audio archives of postwar American poetry. These figures are best represented as new media objects rather than as pictures in books, and I hope that digital humanist projects like these will utilize the web space to query what media will count as <q>texts</q> for literary studies and what types of book-like organizations will be possible in the future.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">A funny story! When I submitted an article to the journal, the anonymous reader objected to my usage of the word <q>mapping</q> and exclaimed that those figures were diagrams. Thus, Diagrammatic Readings was born. I'm currently working on the related book project, <i>Diagrammatic Readings: Essays on Postwar American Poetry, Digital Scholarship, and the Audio Archive</i>, where I will report on the audio research I performed with Dr. James Lee, the principal investigator of the project, at the University of Cincinnati's Digital Scholarship Center. The objective is to develop a general framework for archival research, one that leverages the digital technology for acquisition, analysis, and visualization of archive-based corpus.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">I look at various audio archives of poetry recordings, many of which are housed at university libraries and contain large amounts of postwar American poetry in oral form: viz., the <a href="https://libapps.libraries.uc.edu/main/data/" title="Elliston" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Elliston</a> poetry audio archive housed at the University of Cincinnati; the <a href="https://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/authors.php" title="PennSound" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">PennSound</a> archive at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing; the <a href="https://voca.arizona.edu/" title="Voca" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Voca</a> audiovisual library at the University of Arizona Poetry Center; and <a href="http://www.ubu.com/sound/" title="UbuWeb" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">UbuWeb</a>.</p>
